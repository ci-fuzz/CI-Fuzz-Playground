# C/C++ API Fuzzing
Fuzzing C/C++ API functions can be performed in multiple ways. Generally we first need to compile the target software.
In the second step we will write a fuzz test that call the functions from the target software that we want to test.
This can be done in multiple ways:
- [plain](https://github.com/ci-fuzz/CI-Fuzz-Playground/tree/main/c_cpp/api_fuzzing/plain) contains an example where only a single function is called
  and the inputs generated by the fuzzer are used as parameters for this function
- [chain](https://github.com/ci-fuzz/CI-Fuzz-Playground/tree/main/c_cpp/api_fuzzing/chain) contains an example where multiple functions will 
   be called with every input generated by the fuzzing engine. The input generated by the fuzzer is used for multiple parameters for multiple functions.
- [mocking](https://github.com/ci-fuzz/CI-Fuzz-Playground/tree/main/c_cpp/api_fuzzing/mocking) gives an example for software that cann not be 
   directly run on the fuzzing server. This is often the case when embedded software is fuzzed, because there are hardware dependencies.
