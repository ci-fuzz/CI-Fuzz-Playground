# Chain C/C++ API Fuzz Test
The file [Chain_Fuzz_Test.cpp](https://github.com/ci-fuzz/CI-Fuzz-Playground/blob/main/c_cpp/api_fuzzing/chain/fuzz_targets/Chain_Fuzz_Test.cpp) is 
an example for a C/C++ API fuzz test where with every input generated by the fuzzer, <b>multiple functions</b> are called and the data coming from the fuzzer 
is used as parameters for these functions.
These types of fuzz tests are very useful if stateful applications are fuzzed. In this case the bug can only be found if the application is set into the correct state by calling the correct functions with the correct input parameters beofre executing the vulnerable function.

To make this example easier to understand the code of the target software is also included in the same file as the fuzz test.
