# CI-Fuzz-Playground

Welcome to the CI-Fuzz Playground! This project has been created by Code Intelligence to allow you to learn and explore fuzzing for various use cases and technologies.

## What is fuzzing (in a nutshell)?

Fuzzing is a dynamic code analysis technique that supplies pseudo-random inputs to a software-under-test (SUT), derives new inputs from the behaviour of the program (i.e. how inputs are processed), and monitors the SUT for bugs.

## Use Cases:

* [C and C++](https://github.com/ci-fuzz/CI-Fuzz-Playground/tree/main/c_cpp)
  * [API Fuzzing (Plain, Chain, Mocking)](https://github.com/ci-fuzz/CI-Fuzz-Playground/tree/main/c_cpp/api_fuzzing)
  * [Network Socket Fuzzing (Plain, Chain)](https://github.com/ci-fuzz/CI-Fuzz-Playground/tree/main/c_cpp/network_socket/tcp_server)
* [Java](https://github.com/ci-fuzz/CI-Fuzz-Playground/tree/main/java)
  * [API Fuzzing (Plain, Chain)](https://github.com/ci-fuzz/CI-Fuzz-Playground/tree/main/java/api_fuzzing)
  * [Web App Fuzzing (REST, Web)](https://github.com/ci-fuzz/CI-Fuzz-Playground/tree/main/java/webapp)
  * [gRPC](https://github.com/ci-fuzz/CI-Fuzz-Playground/tree/main/java/grpc)
